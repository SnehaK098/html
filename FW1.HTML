    <p>The environment refers to the surroundings in which life exists on earth. Components like animals, 
        humans, sunlight, water, trees, and air make up the environment. They are the earth’s living and 
        non-living components. Living organisms include trees, humans, and animals. Non-living components 
        such as the sun, water and air are essential for man’s life.
        Both living and non-living organisms are dependent on each other to maintain a balanced ecosystem. 
        A disturbance in any of the categories will create chaos in the entire ecosystem and threaten the
        environment. Just like the growing human population has become a threat to the environment.
        Global warming is a major threat to the environment. The atmosphere and hydrosphere,
        on the other hand, are components of the environment that have an impact on the lives of
        living things. The atmosphere contains gases like oxygen and nitrogen. Every living being 
        is developed according to the characteristics of these components. Aquatic species, for example, 
        are designed to breathe underwater. Aerial animals are designed to live in the air. So even the
        tiniest change in nature’s subtle balance makes it difficult for living organisms to survive in 
        the environment it is designed to live in.</p>
